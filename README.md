# Concurrency Projects

This repository contains a series of Java projects focused on concurrency concepts and multithreading. These projects are ways to learn key concurrency techniques in Java, including thread management, synchronization, locks, thread safety, and more.

## Topics Explored

### 1. **Basic Thread Creation**
   - **Objective:** Introduce basic thread creation using `Thread` and `Runnable`.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Thread instantiation, `run()` method, starting threads.

### 2. **Thread Synchronization**
   - **Objective:** Demonstrate thread synchronization to avoid race conditions.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Synchronized blocks, `synchronized` keyword, critical section.

### 3. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
   - **Objective:** Implement the classic producer-consumer problem using Java concurrency tools.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Inter-thread communication using `wait()` and `notify()`, shared resources.

### 4. **Deadlock Detection and Prevention**
   - **Objective:** Explore the concept of deadlocks and how to prevent them.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Circular dependencies, deadlock detection, resource allocation strategies.

### 5. **Executors and Thread Pooling**
   - **Objective:** Use the `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of threads.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Thread pooling, task submission, handling concurrent tasks.

### 6. **Fork/Join Framework**
   - **Objective:** Implement parallel tasks using the `ForkJoinPool`.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Divide-and-conquer problem solving, `RecursiveTask`, and `RecursiveAction`.

### 7. **Atomic Variables and Locks**
   - **Objective:** Learn to use `AtomicInteger` and `ReentrantLock` for thread-safe operations.
   - **Concepts Covered:** Atomic classes, locks, and custom synchronization.
